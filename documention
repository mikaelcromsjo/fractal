# Fractal Circle User Manual

## What is Fractal Circle?

**Fractal Circle** is a collaborative decision-making tool that helps groups of people discuss ideas, vote on proposals, and select representatives through multiple rounds of discussion—all within Telegram.

Think of it as a "fractal" because the structure repeats: small discussion circles eventually distill down to the most important ideas and the people who should represent them.

---

## How It Works: The Journey

### **Step 1: You Get an Invite**

Someone invites you to join a Fractal Circle meeting on a specific topic. You'll receive an invite message on Telegram with a link to join.

**What to do:** Tap the link and confirm you want to participate. You're now part of the Fractal!

---

### **Step 2: The Fractal Starts**

When the organizer launches the meeting, Telegram sends you a message saying:

> 🚀 **Fractal '[Topic]' has started!**
> 
> 👥 You're in a Circle with [X] other members
> 
> 💬 Chat with your Circle members in this private group chat
> 
> 📝 Open the Dashboard to make proposals and vote

---

### **Step 3: You're in Your First Circle**

You're now part of a **Circle**—a small group (typically 4-8 people) who will discuss the topic together.

**Two things happen:**
1. **A private Telegram group chat opens** where you can chat with your Circle members
2. **You can open the Dashboard** (a web app) to propose ideas and vote

---

## Inside the Dashboard: Round 1

### **Phase A: Proposal & Discussion Phase (First Half of Round)**

For the first half of the round time, you and your Circle focus on:

#### **📝 Making Proposals**
- Click **"+ New Proposal"** to add your idea
- Give it a **title** and **detailed description**
- Hit **"Post"**—it's now visible to your Circle

**Example proposal:**
- **Title:** "Weekly team standups on Monday mornings"
- **Description:** "Brief 15-minute sync to align on priorities and blockers..."

#### **💬 Adding Comments**
- All proposals will be shown one at a time on the Dashboard
- Add comments to refine the idea, ask questions, or add details
- You can add comments throughout the entire round—even during voting phase

#### **⭐ Voting on Comments (1-3 Stars)**
- Each comment gets a star rating:
  - ⭐ = "Interesting point"
  - ⭐⭐ = "Good observation"
  - ⭐⭐⭐ = "Excellent point"
- This helps the group identify the most valuable feedback

---

### **Phase B: Voting Phase (Second Half of Round)**

**Important:** About halfway through the round, you'll get a Telegram message:

> ℹ️ **Half of the time for this round is over**
> 
> Now is the time to vote on all proposals and select a group representative

When this happens:
- **No new proposals** can be created
- **Comments are still welcome**—keep discussing!
- **Focus shifts to voting**

#### **🗳️ Voting on Proposals (1-10 Score)**

You vote on **all proposals** in your Circle by giving each one a score:

- **1-3:** Interesting idea, but not a priority
- **4-6:** Worth considering
- **7-8:** Strong idea, should move forward
- **9-10:** Excellent—definitely should continue to next round

**How voting works:**
1. Read the proposal
2. Click the scoring stars (1-10)
3. Your vote is recorded instantly
4. You can change your vote anytime before the round closes

**What happens to your votes:**
- The system ranks all proposals by their **average scores**
- The **top 2 proposals** from your Circle move to the next round
- Low-scoring proposals are archived

---

### **🥇 Voting for Your Circle Representative**

Near the end of the voting phase, you select who should represent your Circle in the next round.

**How it works:**

You have **3 points to allocate:**
- **🥇 Gold (3 points)** – Your top choice
- **🥈 Silver (2 points)** – Your second choice  
- **🥉 Bronze (1 point)** – Your third choice

**Who can you vote for?**
- Anyone in your Circle **except yourself**

**What happens:**
- Votes are tallied
- The person with the most points becomes your Circle's **representative**
- If there's a tie, the system picks the representative


---

### **Round 1 Ends**

When the round timer expires:

> ℹ️ **The round has ended!**

The system automatically:
1. ✅ Calculates final proposal scores
2. ✅ Selects your Circle's representative
3. ✅ Prepares the next round

---

## Round 2+ (If There Are More Circles)

If there are other Circles, a **Round 2** begins.

### **Who Participates in Round 2?**

Only **representatives** from Round 1 Circles move forward. You'll see a Telegram message:

> 🚀 **The Next Round has started!**
> 
> ⚡ You have been selected to represent your Circle!

If you weren't selected as a representative, **the Fractal journey ends for you**—but you can still view the final results later.

### **What's Different in Round 2?**

**For representatives:**

- You're now in a new Circle with representatives from other first-round Circles
- The **top 2 proposals from your old Circle** are automatically in this new Circle
- You **cannot create new proposals** ❌
- You **can add comments** to existing proposals ✅
- You **vote on proposals** (1-10 scoring) ✅
- You **vote for a new representative** (Gold/Silver/Bronze) ✅

The round structure is **identical** to Round 1, just with pre-selected proposals.

### **Rounds Continue Until One Circle Remains**

The fractal keeps dividing like this:

```
Round 1:  8 Circles of 8 people each (64 people)
           → Top 2 proposals per Circle = 16 proposals
           
Round 2:  8 Representatives (from 8 Circles) = 1 new Circle
           → Top 2 proposals from R2 = 2 proposals
           
Round 3:  1 Representative from Round 2
           → Fractal ends (only 1 person left)
```

The **exact number of rounds** depends on your Circle sizes and how many people participated.

## The Final Results

When the Fractal ends, you'll see the **Results Page**:

### **What's Displayed:**

#### **🏆 Top Ideas (Ranked by Score)**
All proposals that made it to the final round, sorted by their **total vote score**

Each proposal shows:
- **Title & Description**
- **Final Score** (sum of all votes from all rounds)
- **Top Comments** (highest-rated ones—low-scored comments are hidden)

Example:
```
🥇 "Weekly team standups on Monday mornings" 
   Score: 87/10
   
💬 Top Comments:
"This would really help sync across timezones" ⭐⭐⭐ 
"Consider async updates too for remote teams" ⭐⭐

## Common Questions

### **Q: What if I miss the voting phase?**
**A:** Votes are tallied automatically when the round ends. You can still vote right up to the last minute. But try not to wait—vote early so you don't miss the deadline!

### **Q: Can I change my votes?**
**A:** Yes! You can change your proposal votes anytime before the round closes. For representative voting, you can update your Gold/Silver/Bronze allocation.

### **Q: What if my proposal doesn't make the top 2?**
**A:** Only the top 2 proposals advance to the next round. But your comments and ideas may have influenced other proposals—that's how Fractals work! The best ideas rise to the top across all proposals.

### **Q: Can I see who voted for whom?**
**A:** No, voting is **anonymous**. You can't see other people's individual votes—only the final scores and results. (Full vote information is stored in the database)

### **Q: What if I'm a representative in Round 2—do I have to participate?**
**A:** You're expected to! Representatives carry the voice of their Circle forward. If you can't make it, let the organizer know ASAP.

### **Q: How are ties broken?**
**A:** If two proposals or candidates have the same score, the system uses a tiebreaker (e.g., who got more votes, or a random selection). The organizer will explain their specific tiebreaker rules.

### **Q: Can I go back and see old rounds?**
**A:** Yes! After the Fractal ends, you can view the history of all rounds, proposals, and voting. This creates a transparent record of the decision-making process.

### **Q: What if someone is rude or off-topic?**
**A:** Report it to the Fractal organizer. They can moderate or remove disruptive members. The fractal is also self-organising and disruptive members will unlikely go the a second round.
